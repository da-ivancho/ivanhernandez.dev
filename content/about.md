## Who am I?

I am a professional Software Developer since 2012. My main focus has been on software maintenance in the Enterprise Software Industry.

I am originally from Venezuela and currently living in Germany.

This blog is about my interests and projects. The idea is to document my learning journey on the different topics that I am interested in (outside my 9-to-5) and share it with the world.

Feel free to reach me at ivan@ivanhernandez.dev.
